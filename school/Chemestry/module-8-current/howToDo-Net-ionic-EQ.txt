first write balanced equations of compounds

then write out all ions of compounds unless it is a Solid or liquid (not aquius i.e. aq)

then cross out all things that repeat (i.e. Ca + Li → Ca Cl) this is not a correct example but you would cross out both Ca on both sides and the net ionic EQ would be (Li → Cl)
