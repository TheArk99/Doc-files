it is easy for little sins to creep into our lives, before we realize it we are seperated
from god.

we think we are spiritualy on track, but in reality we are distanced from god when we go 
through the rythms 



Psalm 51:16-17
New International Version
16 You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it;
    you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
17 My sacrifice, O God, is[a] a broken spirit;
    a broken and contrite heart
    you, God, will not despise.


Micah 6:8
New International Version
8 He has shown you, O mortal, what is good.
    And what does the Lord require of you?
To act justly and to love mercy
    and to walk humbly[a] with your God.

These verses tell me that God wants me to know god and to follow what
god says and that I should 'act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with god'.


"The same mighty truths that were revealed through these men, God desires to reveal through the 
youth and the children of today. The greatest want of the world is the want of men-- 
men who will not be bought or sold; men who in their inmost souls are true and hones; men who do not
fear to call sin by its reight name; men whoose conscience is as true to duty
as the needle to the pole; men whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole; men 
who will stand for the right though the heavens fall." --Ellen G. White, Education, P.57.


2 corinthians 8: 11-12

11 Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched 
by your completion of it, according to your means. 12 For if the willingness is 
there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what 
one does not have.


If we struggle God simmply asks us to give a willing spirt. 
Because this is the starting point for faith.
