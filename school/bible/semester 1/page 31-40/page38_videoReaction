I still think that the hosea strory is needing 'reimaging' not recreating  because the story is about a man a couple thousand years ago marring a 
women that had a job not a lifestyle in being a prostute, on top of that the story hosea was already told that she would be 'unfaithful' 
to me the story is the same jsut with some fancy new 'modern'  clothes about a 'rechious' man that is only about the 'horrible, unfaithful', 
"terrible" wife that the man needs to go and rescue and that he is a recious man that saved this desprate women. 

While yes that is how the story was intened, there is also the context of it being a stroy for people a couple thousands years ago.
